Good day.

1. You need to have the following installed: pygame and neat-python.

	pip install pygame
	pip install neat-python

2. There should be 7 assets:
	4 rockets, 1 icon, 1 landing pad, 1 mars background.

3. There should be 1 "config.txt" file, this is used for the NEAT algorithm. Any configuration changes should be done here.

4. There are 2 python files: agentManual.py and main.py

	main.py - This is the actual program, simply run it and watch it work, no need to do anything.
		  As stated above, any modifications should be done in the config file.

	agentManual.py - This is the code converted to be suitable for the NEAT algorithm.
			 This file still retains input commands so you can control the agent
			 using the UP, RIGHT, LEFT arrow keys. Have fun!

	NOTE: The resolution of this appplication is quite large, the background is 690x993. I had no issues
		on my desktop 1920x1080 screen.
